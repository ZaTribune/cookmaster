while performing integrated tests you'll notice that

- testing repositories -> the springJPA will only load the data in the "data.sql" file.
- testing services -> the springJPA will load the data from both the "data.sql" anf the bootstrap class.

  Note: repositories' tests are annotated with @DataJpaTest wheres services' tests are annotated with @SpringBootTest
  Note: the repository interface is not annotated with any spring boot Stereotype annotations wheres services do.
  Note: case 2 , data is loaded first from the sql file.
